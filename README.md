I'm Giacomo, a 17 year old student from Italy.
I've always loved programming, and I am now in my fourth year of a thechnical institute, and my course specializes in computer science.

We are leaning languages like C#(along with MAUI and Winforms) and Python. We are also learning web developement with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
We also learned the basics of Assembly and how the CPU registers work.
For school I mainly use Visual Studio, but for personal use i prefer programming in Neovim.

I worked on many small projects, for specific purposes(tracking tool with data visualisation features for specific metrics, and a tool to show charts of dynamic time frames from data) or specific skills(list management in c++).

I love working togheter with people and travelling, for example I have participated in making and presented a virtual reality project with my school centered on safe training, both to a *Scuola Futura Campus* event, and to the Rome Maker Faire.

I speak Italian, and I recently obtained my B2 certification in English.
